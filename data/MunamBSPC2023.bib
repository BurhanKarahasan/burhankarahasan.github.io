abstract = {Non-invasive ventilation has become increasingly popular with recent technological advancements, and with the adaption of turbine-based respiratory support, NIV devices are becoming more accessible. Non-Invasive ventilation consists of a single limb or a dual limb circuit, with the dual limb being the most sophisticated. However, single limb vented circuit being the most widely adopted. The use of proximal to mask flow, pressure, and external physiological sensors are still not widely adapted to the single limb vented circuit, restricting the quality of ventilation support, primarily in-home care scenarios. We present a novel study that implements a real-time wireless pressure and flow sensor control system to a bi-level ventilator for a modular approach towards non-invasive ventilatory support. Tidal Volume, Inspiratory trigger delay, time to minimum pressure, and flow and pressure curves examined present a proximal to patient wireless system that can enhance the performance of a single limb passive vented circuit.}
